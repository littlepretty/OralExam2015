% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
Realistic and scalable testing systems are critical to evaluate network applications and protocols to ensure successful real system deployments. Container-based network emulation is attractive because of the combination of many desired features of network simulators (scalability, low cost, reproducibility, and flexibility) and physical testbeds (high fidelity). 
The success of Mininet, a popular software-defined networking (SDN) emulation testbed, demonstrates the value of such approach that we can execute unmodified binary code on a large-scale emulated network with lightweight OS-level virtualization techniques. However, an ordinary network emulator uses the system clock across all the containers even if a container is not being scheduled to run. This leads to the issue of temporal fidelity, especially with high workloads. 
Virtual time sheds the light on the issue of preserving temporal fidelity for large-scale emulation. 
The key insight is to trade time with system resources via precisely scaling the time of interactions between containers and physical devices by a factor of $n$, hence, making an emulated network appear to be $n$ times faster from the viewpoints of applications in the container.
In this paper, we develop a lightweight Linux-container-based virtual time system and integrate the system to Mininet for fidelity and scalability enhancement. 
We also explore adaptive time dilation scheduling for balancing speed and accuracy. 
Experimental results demonstrate that 
(1) with virtual time, Mininet is able to accurately emulate a network $n$ times larger in scale, where $n$ is the scaling factor, with the system behaviors closely match data obtained from a physical testbed; and 
(2) with a threshold-based time dilation scheduling, we reduce the running time by 46\% with little accuracy loss. 
Finally, we present a case study using the virtual-time-enabled Mininet to evaluate the limitations of equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing in a data center network.
