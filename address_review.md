Address comments in REVIEW
============================
1. modify typos like "SDN-based architecture" and "ECMP"
2. Use adaptor throughout the entire paper: Time dilation Adaptor in design architecture, python module DilationAdaptor
3. modify typos in Algorithm 1. Also explain why set virtual_time_nsec to 0 at the beginning.
4. explain "observed very similar behaviors": we did not mean that between different runs, emulation results are similar; the data are different and not comparable between runs. The similar behavior is that for every run, we can observe the chaos like shown in figure 5a.
5. about the adaptive time dilation algorithm: we mentioned that it is still in the scope of future works.
6. give several benchmark score, both CPU and FPU, for the machine in evaluation section.
7. adjust bibliography: balanced last page; replace Anonymous to Jinâ€™s papers.
